# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Titanic dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which includes various features about the passengers.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about passengers such as:

- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## Usage

1. **Open the Google Colab notebook**: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zjwWraflkH4RP4DA8Ta6NHL3BDbWj8PH?usp=sharing
2. **Run the cells in the notebook sequentially** to perform the following tasks:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Train and evaluate the model
   - Make predictions

## Model

Details about the machine learning model used:

- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation results are displayed in the notebook.
